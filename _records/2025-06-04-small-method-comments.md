Q9: DFT results highlight low adatom activation energy on (111) surfaces , but the model assumes idealized slab structures. How do defects (e.g., dislocations, grain boundary junctions) in real comp-Cu affect the predicted surface diffusion pathways? Are there experimental observations (e.g., TEM of bonding interfaces) that corroborate the DFT-predicted preferential migration on (111) planes?

We thank the reviewer for his careful reading and valuable consideration of our DFT results. We emphasize that
