High resolution resistors capable of detecting minuscule currents are vital for advanced sensors, but existing off-shelf models struggle with inconsistent resistance under varying voltages. The underlying physics of this issue is rooted in unstable surface charges and intrinsic inhomogeneity of surface potential caused by spontaneous polarization (SP) in commercial semi-insulating silicon carbide (SiC) devices. In this work, we found that coating SiC surfaces with an ultrathin zinc oxide layer immobilizes the dangling surface charges in place and balances the natural electric field of the material, ensuring stable resistance even at extreme voltages up to 1000 V. The resulting SiC resistor maintains a record-high resistance of one peta-ohm ($10^{15} {\Omega}$) with negligible voltage fluctuations, outperforming conventional options. Additionally, these devices can switch states when exposed to light or heat, making them dual-purpose tools for ultra-sensitive measurements and sensors. This breakthrough combines high stability, scalability for mass production, and multifunctionality, opening doors to next-generation precision technologies in fields like quantum sensing and environmental monitoring.
